# MLInVeh
This is a machine learning framework and toolset for vehicle detection and identification.MLInVehSensorAnalysisTool is one of the toolsets, and is a tool for collecting and analyzing data from geomagnetic sensors and data visualization. We can use this tool to analyze the collected data to prepare for the next step to build a machine learning model. The image shown below is the image captured when a magnetic field changes around the sensor.

This tool has the following characteristics:
1). The collected sensor data information can be saved, and the stored historical data information can be read and analyzed;
2). The sensor data chart is displayed in real time;
3). Receive data using the serial interface.
More features waiting for further development...
